Welcome to my site, where I collect various reflections related to engineering cloud-native systems.

I am primarily interested in understanding and applying engineering principles and practices for managing the complexity inherent in modern software systems, especially in relation to repeatably and reliably delivering software applications into their operating environments.

Why 'Pattern Engineer'? In my years spent in QA, software, and systems engineering, I believe one powerful way to manage this complexity and improve the standards of my work has been to recognize recurring classes of problems and apply the patterns which have arisen to address them.

As these pages are primarily intended as a way for me to clarify my own thinking on a topic, they may not always contain novel insights for expert practitioners, but if others are able to gain some value from them as well that would be fantastic.

For more information, keep an eye on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ohdle), which I plan to gradually build out after years of working on mostly private projects.
